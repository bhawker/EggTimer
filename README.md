# EggTimer

Introducing Egg Timer, a simple countdown timer app for Garmin Connect IQ watches. The application displays a user-entered countdown timer and the current time.

Application features include:

-   Add a countdown timer with a duration up to 8 hours
-   Watch vibrates when stopping or starting the timer, and when the countdown finishes, if vibration setting is enabled
-   Display current time in user's specified format (12/24 hour), including seconds
-   Remembers previous duration and elapsed time when exiting application with Back button
- 	If the timer is running and the "Timer continues when exiting app" setting is enabled, the time continues to elapse after exiting the app
-   Remembers previously entered timer duration when creating a new timer
-   When a timer elapses (reaches 00:00), pressing the Action button restarts it from the previous duration
-   When the application is relaunched and the timer had previously elapsed, the timer is set to the previously entered duration
